Well, this is it.  Actually putting some skills into practice.
By the end of this project I will be able to show that I can build a simple website.
I will demonstrate use of HTML with Headings, Lists, Links, and Images.
I will show that I can use git with good Commit Messages, and commands (e.g. git add, git commit and, ulitmately git push origin main).
